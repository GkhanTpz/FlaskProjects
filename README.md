# FlaskProject

A simple and modular Flask web application built for educational and internal use. This project demonstrates fundamental web development concepts such as routing, form handling, database integration, and frontend templating using Flask and Jinja2.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧩 Modular structure with `blueprints`
- 📄 HTML templating with Jinja2
- 📥 Form handling (GET/POST)
- 💾 SQLite/MySQL backend (configurable)
- 🔐 Basic security practices (input validation, error handling)
- 🧪 Unit testing setup
